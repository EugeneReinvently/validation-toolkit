## Introduction

Validation Kit is designed to be a lightweight framework specialised in user data validation, such as email format, input lenght or passwords matching.

At the core of this project are the following principles:

- Separation of concerns
- Availability on all pltaforms 
- Open to extensibility

### Separation of concerns

Think of Validation Kit as to an adjustable wrench more than to a swiss knife. 
With this idea in mind, the Validation Kit is composed from a small set of protocols, classes and structs than ca be easaly used to fit your project needs.

### All pltaforms availability

Since validation can take place at any level, Validation Kit was designed to support iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS and native swift projects, such as server apps.

### Open to extensibility

Every project is uniq in it's challanges and it's great when we can focus on solving them instead on focusig on boiler plate tasks. 
While Validation Kit is compact and offers all you need to build validation around your project needs, Validation Components extends it by adding the common validations that most of the projects can benefits of.
This includes validation predicates for email, requred, password matching, url and many other.     

## Instalation

### Carthage

The full documentation on how to install and use [Carthage][carthage] is available on their oficial github [page][carthage].

To use the latest stable version, add this to your [`Cartfile`][carthage-cartfile]:

``` github "alexcristea/validation-kit" ```

To use a certain version, add this to your [`Cartfile`][carthage-cartfile]:

``` github "alexcristea/validation-kit" >= 0.1.0 ```

To use the latest version in development, add this to your [`Cartfile`][carthage-cartfile]:

``` github "alexcristea/validation-kit" "develop" ```

## Concepts

### ValidationPredicate

The ```ValidationPredicate``` represents the core ```protocol``` and has the role to ```evaluate``` if an input value matches on a given predicate.

Out of the box, ValidationKit brings the following predicates, which allow the developers to construct their specific predicates:
- ```RegexValidationPredicate```
- ```BlockValidationPredicate```

For more advanced or complex predicates the developers can extend the ```ValidationPredicate``` to fit the project needs.

### ValidationConstraint

A ```ValidationConstraint``` represents a structure that link a ```ValidationPredicate``` with a custom message, useful for user feedback.

### Validator

A ```Validator``` represents a collection of constratints and allows the evaluation to be made on:
- any of the constraints
- all constraints

To provice context, a ```Validator``` allows to constrain an input as being required and as being a valid email.
