## Introduction

`ValidationToolkit` is designed to be a lightweight framework specialised in data validation, such as email format, input length or passwords matching.

At the core of this project are the following principles:

- Separation of concerns
- Availability on all platforms
- Open to extensibility

### Separation of concerns

Think of `ValidationToolkit` as to an adjustable wrench more than to a Swiss knife.

With this idea in mind, the toolkit is composed from a small set of protocols, structs and classes than can be easily composed to fit your project needs.

### All platforms availability

Since validation can take place at many levels, `ValidationToolkit` is designed to support iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS and native Swift projects, such as server apps.

### Open to extensibility

Every project is unique in it's challenges and it's great when we can focus on solving them instead of spending our time on boilerplate tasks.

`ValidationToolkit` is compact and offers you the foundation you need to build data validation around your project needs. In addition, it includes a set of common validation predicates that most of the projects can benefit of: email validation, required fields, password matching, url validation and many more to come.

## Requirements
- iOS 8.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Xcode 8.1+
- Swift 3.0+

## Installation

### Carthage

You can use [Carthage][url-carthage] to install `ValidationToolkit` by adding it to your [`Cartfile`][url-carthage-cartfile]:

```
github "nsagora/validation-toolkit"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `ValidationToolkit.framework` into your Xcode project.

<details>
<summary>Setting up Carthage</summary>

[Carthage][url-carthage] is a decentralised dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install [Carthage][url-carthage] with [Homebrew][url-homebrew] using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

</details>

### CocoaPods

You can use [CocoaPods][url-cocoapods] to install `ValidationToolkit` by adding it to your [`Podfile`][url-cocoapods-podfile]:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
	pod 'ValidationToolkit'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Note that this requires CocoaPods version 1.0.0, and your iOS deployment target to be at least 8.0.

<details>
<summary>Setting up CocoaPods</summary>

[CocoaPods][url-cocoapods] is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```
</details>

### Swift Package Manager

You can use the [Swift Package Manager][url-swift-package-manager] to install `ValidationToolkit` by adding it to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/nsagora/validation-toolkit", majorVersion: 1),
    ]
)
```

Note that the [Swift Package Manager][url-swift-package-manager] is still in early design and development, for more information checkout its [GitHub Page][url-swift-package-manager-github].

### Manually
To use this library in your project manually you may:

1. for Projects, just drag the `Sources` folder into the project tree
2. for Workspaces, include the whole `ValidationToolkit.xcodeproj`

## Usage example
For a comprehensive list of examples try the `ValidationToolikit.playground`:

1. Download the repository locally on your machine
2. Open `ValidationToolkit.workspace`
3. Build `ValidationToolkit iOS` target
4. Select the `ValidationToolkit` playgrounds from the Project navigator.

### Predicates

The `Predicate` represents the core `protocol` and has the role to `evaluate` if an input matches on a given validation condition.

At `ValidationToolkit`'s core we have the following two predicates, which allow developers to compose predicates specific to the project needs.

<details>
<summary>RegexPredicate</summary>

```swift
let predicate = RegexPredicate(expression: "^[a-z]$")
predicate.evaluate(with: "a") // returns true
predicate.evaluate(with: "5") // returns false
predicate.evaluate(with: "ab") // returns false
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>BlockPredicate</summary>

```swift
let pred = BlockPredicate<String> { $0.characters.count > 2 }
predicate.evaluate(with: "a") // returns false
predicate.evaluate(with: "abc") // returns true
```
</details>

In addition, the toolkit offers a set of common validation predicates that your project can benefit of:

<details>
<summary>EmailPredicate</summary>

```swift
let predicate = EmailPredicate()
predicate.evaluate(with: "hello@") // returns false
predicate.evaluate(with: "hello@nsagora.com") // returns true
predicate.evaluate(with: "hÃ©llo@nsagora.com") // returns true
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>URLPredicate</summary>

```swift
let predicate = URLPredicate()
predicate.evaluate(with: "http://www.url.com") // returns true
predicate.evaluate(with: "http:\\www.url.com") // returns false
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>PairMatchingPredicate</summary>

```swift
let predicate = PairMatchingPredicate()
predicate.evaluate(with: ("swift", "swift")) // returns true
predicate.evaluate(with: ("swift", "obj-c")) // returns false
```
</details>

On top of that, developers can build more advanced or complex predicates by extending the `Predicate` protocol, and/ or by composing or decorating the existing predicates:

<details>
<summary>Custom Predicate</summary>

```swift
public class MinLenghtPredicate: Predicate {

    public typealias InputType = String

    private let minLenght:Int

    public init(minLenght:Int) {
        self.minLenght = minLenght
    }

    public func evaluate(with input: String) -> Bool {
        return input.characters.count >= minLenght
    }
}

let predicate = MinLenghtPredicate(minLenght: 5)
predicate.evaluate(with: "alph") // returns false
predicate.evaluate(with: "alpha") // returns true
predicate.evaluate(with: "alphabet") // returns true
```
</details>

### Constraints

A `PredicateConstraint` represents a data type that links a `Predicate` to an `Error`, in order to provide useful feedback for the end users.

<details>
<summary>PredicateConstraint</summary>

```swift
let predicate = BlockPredicate<String> { $0 == "Mr. Goodbytes" }
let constraint = PredicateConstraint(predicate: predicate, error: MyError.magicWord)

let result = constraint.evaluate(with: "please")
switch result {
case .valid:
    print("access granted...")
case .invalid(let summary):
    print("Ah Ah Ah! You didn't say the magic word!")
}  // prints "Ah Ah Ah! You didn't say the magic word!"
```

```swift
enum MyError:Error {
    case magicWord
}
```
</details>

### Constraint Sets

A `ConstraintSet` represents a collection of constraints that allows the evaluation to be made on:

- any of the constraints
- all constraints

To provide context, a `ConstraintSet` allows us to constraint a piece of data as being required and also as being a valid email.

<details>
<summary>ConstraintSet</summary

An example is that of the registration form, whereby users are prompted to enter a strong *password*. This process typically entails some form of validation, but the logic itself is often unstructured and spread out through a view controller.

`ValidationToolkit` seeks instead to consolidate, standardise, and make explicit the logic that is being used to validate user input. To this end, the below example demonstrates construction of a full `ConstraintSet` object that can be used to enforce requirements on the user's password data:

```swift
let lowerCase = RegexPredicate(expression: "^(?=.*[a-z]).*$")
let upperCase = RegexPredicate(expression: "^(?=.*[A-Z]).*$")
let digits = RegexPredicate(expression: "^(?=.*[0-9]).*$")
let specialChars = RegexPredicate(expression: "^(?=.*[!@#\\$%\\^&\\*]).*$")
let minLenght = RegexPredicate(expression: "^.{8,}$")

var passwordConstraints = ConstraintSet<String>()
passwordConstraints.add(predicate: lowerCasePredicate, error: Form.Password.missingLowercase)
passwordConstraints.add(predicate: upperCasePredicate, error: Form.Password.missingUpercase)
passwordConstraints.add(predicate: digitsPredicate, error: Form.Password.missingDigits)
passwordConstraints.add(predicate: specialChars, error: Form.Password.missingSpecialChars)
passwordConstraints.add(predicate: minLenght, error: Form.Password.minLenght(8))

let password = "3nGuard!"
let result = passwordConstraints.evaluateAll(input: password)

switch result {
case .valid:
    print("Wow, that's a ðŸ’ª password!")
case .invalid(let summary):
    print(summary.errors.map({$0.localizedDescription}))
} // prints "Wow, that's a ðŸ’ª password!"
```

From above, we see that once we've constructed the `passwordConstraints`, we're simply calling `evaluateAll(input:)` to get a `Summary` of our evaluation result. This summary can then be handled as we please.
